### Presentation :

>My name is Enzo and I'm 23 years old. I'm currently studying computer science (AI oriented) in Caen, France. After completing my bachelor's degree I would like to do a master's degree in AI, and a PhD after that.

My goal is to work somewhere between Neuroscience, Biology, Computer science ... in companies such as Neuralink. I'm sharing some school or personal projects here so I can keep track of my evolution.
